This bundle detects automatically if you have installed the SEO Bundle. If so, it will disable the request event listener to keep things straight and prevent strategy mixes!
Please read [more about seo bundle configuration](./01_SeoBundleUsage.md) and how to configure this bundle if you're using this bundle in combination with the SEO Bundle.

## Standalone Usage
Please read [more about standalone configuration](./02_StandaloneUsage.md) and how to configure this bundle if you're using this bundle as a standalone version.
